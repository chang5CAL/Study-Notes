KMP: When looking for most matching strings in a nested for loop, move the 

Anagrams: To find if an object is an anagram, simply put all characters in to a 26(27 for space) array, and
sort it. Repeat to the compared object, then check if they are the same.
Alternatively, only do that to one, and subtract one from the array, returning false if the value at the area
is 0 pre-calculation, and true if you are finished and all elements are 0.
Of course, always make sure they're the same length.
Another way is to put all characters in a vector and then sort it.

Note: Copy by hand if answer is not found in one hour.
