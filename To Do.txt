Continue MIT's Intro to Algorithms (2011). This is especially important during the break. You might just want
to watch it without notes unless it seems REALLY important. 

Artificial Intelligence and Cryptography might be interesting, but algorithms is the most important.

Finals week, make sure to study. After that, ALgorithms course for MIT. Even if it fills, you can still take
MIT's course and then use THAT

Tomorrow's the last final, but it's physics. Study for that.
